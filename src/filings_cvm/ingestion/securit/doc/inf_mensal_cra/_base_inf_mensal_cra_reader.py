"""Shared base for the CVM *Informe Mensal CRA* (INF_MENSAL_CRA) ingestion readers.

``inf_mensal_cra_AAAA.zip`` (dataset ``SECURIT/DOC/INF_MENSAL_CRA``) ships **8 members** — the
sections of the monthly report of the **CRA** (*Certificado de Recebíveis do Agronegócio*)
operations: geral, ativo/passivo, classe, direitos creditórios, desembolso, fluxo de caixa,
derivativos and cedente/devedor. Every member shares the four-column key prefix (``CNPJ_Emissora``,
``Codigo_Identificacao_Certificado``, ``Data_Referencia``, ``Versao``) then carries its own
section-specific columns. The 8 are a **uniform family** — same artifact, same key — differing only
in which section each carries.

Rather than repeat the download → unzip → select-member → read logic in each of the 8 public
readers, that logic lives here once. This is a **private** base (leading underscore, its own file):
consumers import the 8 concrete ``InfMensalCra*Reader`` adapters, never this class. Each concrete
reader is a thin subclass that sets four class attributes — the member's stem (``_MEMBER_STEM``),
its :class:`FileContract`, its date columns (``_DATE_COLS``) and a human ``_LABEL``.

⚠️ **Yearly-partitioned despite being a monthly report.** The archive is
``inf_mensal_cra_AAAA.zip`` and its members are ``inf_mensal_cra_<section>_AAAA.csv``, so
``date_ref`` selects the **year** (only ``date_ref.year`` is read) — the OTS/FII pattern, not the
FIDC one. A year's file holds every month's rows, keyed by ``Data_Referencia``.

⚠️ **This is the CRA sibling of the OTS family, not a copy of it.** The two dumps share the section
names and this reader's shape, but **not one of the 8 column lists is the same** — CRA is agro-
specific (13 extra receivable buckets in ``direitos_creditorios``, ``*_Commodities_Agricolas`` in
``derivativos``, ``Cadeia_Producao``/``Tipo_Segmento`` in ``geral``), and OTS's key column
``CNPJ_Securitizadora`` is ``CNPJ_Emissora`` here. See ``contracts/inf_mensal_cra.py``.

**Date columns are per-member, not shared** (hence ``_DATE_COLS`` on each subclass, with no default
here): every member has ``Data_Referencia``, ``geral`` adds three more and ``classe`` one. Notably
``Indice_Subordinacao_Data_Base`` (in ``classe``) is **not** a date despite its name — its real
values are numeric (``0.00``) — so it is deliberately absent from that reader's ``_DATE_COLS``.

All 8 readers download the *same* yearly archive, so a ``path_raw`` written by any one serves the
others. No grain is asserted: ``classe`` and ``cedente_devedor`` are naturally long (many rows per
certificate).
